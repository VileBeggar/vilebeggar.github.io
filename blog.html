            <p>pretty happy with how the site is turning out. i found a community that shares pretty much the same interests as me. it's nice to be able to talk to like-minded people. feels good to have a place i can draw stuff for, that everyone enjoys</p>
            <p>on the real life side of things, there's a lot of people looking up to me, and pressure keeps piling up from a lot of things. it's getting a bit straining, and i really hope i don't buckle and fail them. it's not that i don't have time to do the things i need to do, it's just that i don't know how to use my time effectively. hopefully i can finish up my projects for tonight. if i can, it'll be a good stepping stone for the future.</p>
            <p>you guys ever played trepang2? i played it ages ago. it's such a good game. i love being a nameless, masked grunt that can kick ass.</p>

            <p>i recommend it to anyone who even has the slighest of interest in fps games. i had a ton of fun with it. it has a really entertaining survival mode. kind of similar to ultrakill's, in a way.</p>
            <p>i'll probably keep doing these blogs sporadically, while including some games i played into these posts. it's fun to reminisce about these things</p>

            <summary>27.03.2025 - cool stuff</summary>
            <p>all of my friends (bar 1) made their own personal webpages, so i had to get into the loop too. i abhor web design but it is what it is. i got like a crap ton of stuff to catch up on so this website is pretty barren and sucky and nonfunctioning.</p>
            <p>been playing a bit of xcom 2 though. very fun game. i played it in the past but i was a silly little kid back then so i didn't get much of it.</p>
            <p>vipers are cool, but they're probably one of the least threatening enemies now that i've played it for a more solid time. the bounding ability is pretty much a free ticket for me to get a critical hit on them.</p>
            <p>i've lost a good dozen troopers to a lot of enemies but never a viper. i always wanted an excuse to draw one soooooooooooo............</p>
