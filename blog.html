                <h3>27.03.2025 - cool stuff</h3>
                <p>all of my friends (bar 1) made their own personal webpages, so i had to get into the loop too. i abhor web design but it is what it is. i got like a crap ton of stuff to catch up on so this website is pretty barren and sucky and nonfunctioning.</p>
                <p>been playing a bit of xcom 2 though. very fun game. i played it in the past but i was a silly little kid back then so i didn't get much of it.</p>
                <p>vipers are cool, but they're probably one of the least threatening enemies now that i've played it for a more solid time. the bounding ability is pretty much a free ticket for me to get a critical hit on them.</p>
                <p>i've lost a good dozen troopers to a lot of enemies but never a viper. i always wanted an excuse to draw one soooooooooooo............</p>
