                    <p>i did lot of drawings involving corrupted xenos (greenos). i just like aliums. this one took a bit to make but i was still getting a hang of drawing with a graphic tablet at this point.</p>

                    <p>a very fast drawing (2 hours) i did for one of my friends. i did it right after i got my graphics tablet, and i was pretty amazed at how fast i could work with it compard with a mouse.</p>

                    <p>the first thing i drew with my graphic tablet when i got it. it was a friend's request. video showcases one of their projects, a vtol aircraft. pretty cool shit even though i only got to interact with it once. my internet is pretty bad these days so i can't play much of the game, sadly.</p>

                    <p>an even older paint.net drawing, which took way too much time for how rough it looks. still, people found it pretty funny and weirdly enough it's my best recieved scribble on the server.</p>

                    <p>might be the 2nd or 3rd drawing i made, and it's of another friend from CM. i don't know what happened to them, they pretty much cut off contact with everyone i know, AFAIK. hopefully they're doing alright.</p>
